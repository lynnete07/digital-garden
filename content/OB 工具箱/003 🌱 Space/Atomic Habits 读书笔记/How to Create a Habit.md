### What is Habit
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic 
- 建立良好 Habit 的根本目的是用最少的精力（energy and effort）去解决人生的问题。
- 大脑就像一台机器，使用稳定、节能的方式维持日常运转，释放出内存做高价值的事情。

### Four Stages of Habit

![[Media.pdf 5.png]]


### Skills in Practice 
- 建立Routine
- 在已有的习惯基础上，增加新的习惯作为连续动作
- 如果希望自己逐渐减少某类行为，可以在想做的事情前面加规则，做一个需要做的
- 为自己建立唤起愉悦和专注的小仪式

---

## Make it Obvious
- 厘清自己的习惯，特别是无意识的
- 创建习惯循环
- 环境比自制力重要

1. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
2. Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
3. Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
4. Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

>A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form

>The way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. 

## Make it Attractive
- 每做一件想做的事情，同时做一个需要做的事情
- 试着在真正快乐的事情前面加一个仪式，这个“仪式”也会成为产生动力的来源

1. Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
3. Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

>Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use.

>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.

>Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile. Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat. Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.

## Make it Easy
- 做100个作业和只做1个完美作业的例子，想没有意义，行动起来最重要
- 从“仪式”开始，在每个决策时刻做好选择，形成Good Day
- 两分钟原则，开始一个新习惯，切成一个2分钟可以完成的颗粒度

1. Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
2. Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3. Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
4. Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
5. Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

>Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.

>Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. I want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape > I need to exercise > I need to change into my workout clothes.

## Make it Satisfying
- 每完成一个动作，建立一个直接的激励
- keep habits on track. 可视化进展

1. Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
2. Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.
3. Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”
4. Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.
