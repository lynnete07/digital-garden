## 000 - Knowledge Management

TheÂ [Meta PKM](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Meta+PKM)Â shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use theÂ [LYT Kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/LYT+Kit)Â to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. TheÂ [Mapping MOCs](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Mapping+MOCs)Â is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:

- [Notebox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Notebox)Â |Â [LOL](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/LOL)Â |Â [I want to...](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/I+want+to...)
- [Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cartographer's+Corner+%F0%9F%97%BA)Â |Â [Commonplace Book](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Commonplace+Book)Â |Â [Knowledge and memory MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Knowledge+and+memory+MOC)

## 100 - Personal Management

TheÂ [Thinking MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Thinking+MOC)Â can galvanize my attention; theÂ [Concepts MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Concepts+MOC)Â can flavor it; and theÂ [Habits MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Habits+MOC)Â speaks about how to direct it. Hidden within in theÂ [Cabin](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Cabin). Go to myÂ [Life Map](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Life+Map)Â to brush up onÂ [My Virtues](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/My+Virtues+(starter))Â and more.

- [Posture MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Posture+MOC)Â |Â [Hormesis MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Hormesis+MOC)Â |Â [Breathing Exercises MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Breathing+Exercises+MOC)Â | Flowcreation MOC
- People MOC | Family MOC |Â [Prominent People (kit)](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Prominent+People+(kit))
- Efforts MOC |Â [Life Command âŒ˜](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Life+Command+%E2%8C%98)Â | Plans and Reviews
- Finances MOC | Health MOC

## 200 - Philosophy, Psychology ; Spirituality, Religion

Is there no limit to this section? I useÂ [Philosophy MOC (kit)](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Philosophy+MOC+(kit))Â as the big note and then point to things like:Â [Stoicism MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Stoicism+MOC),Â [Confucianism MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Confucianism+MOC),Â [Religion MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Religion+MOC),Â [Taoism MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Taoism+MOC), and whatever else comes up.

[Psychology MOC (kit)](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Psychology+MOC+(kit))Â is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 - Social Sciences ðŸ‘¥

_The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society._  
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. The best place to start is theÂ [People MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/People+MOC). along with.

See also:Â [Prominent People ðŸŒ‹](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/People+MOC#Prominent%20People%20%F0%9F%8C%8B)Â | Politics | Society | Law | Relationships

## 400 - Communications, Language, & Linguistics

A fun section of the library, the 400s contains [[Language MOC]] which involve strategies for learning new languages. Not too far behind is theÂ [[Leadership MOC]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences

A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explore the natural world and universe in glorious notes likeÂ [Cosmology MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cosmology+MOC)Â andÂ [Math MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Math+MOC).

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals |Â [Systems MOC (kit)](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Systems+MOC+(kit))

## 600 - Applied Sciences

A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the the fundamentals of nature andÂ _apply_Â them. My undergrad was inÂ [Engineering MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Engineering+MOC), which relates to my interest inÂ [Building Homes MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Building+Homes+MOC). Later on, I developed theÂ [Editing Manual MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Editing+Manual+MOC).

See also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical |Â [AI MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/AI+MOC)Â | Programming |Â [Collective Intelligence MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Collective+Intelligence+MOC)Â |Â [Genetics MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Genetics+MOC)Â |

## 700 - Art & Recreation

Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon.

- Art MOC |Â [Design MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Design+MOC)Â | Architecture | Painting |
- Film & TV |Â [Movies MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Movies+MOC)
- Sports |Â [Football MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Football+MOC)
- Music |Â [Jazz MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Jazz+MOC)Â |Â [Vocals MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Vocals+MOC)
- [Cooking MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cooking+MOC)Â | Leisure

## 800 - Literature

If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. UseÂ [Literature MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Literature+MOC)Â as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography

I've noticed I'm naturally building up theÂ [Ancient Greece MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Ancient+Greece+MOC), but I haven't cared to build out theÂ [History MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/History+MOC)Â just yet. TheÂ [Places MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Places+MOC)Â is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

TheÂ [Art & Science Storytelling MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Art+%26+Science+Storytelling+MOC)Â look at some great storytellers of history.
