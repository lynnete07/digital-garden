## The Behavior of Language Mastery
let's consider how [[Tinbergen's Four Questions]] might apply to the behavior of language mastery, the process of becoming proficient in a language:

1. **Causation (Mechanism)**: What are the immediate physiological or environmental factors that lead to language mastery? This could include _exposure to the language in various contexts, repeated practice, and the cognitive processes involved in learning and memory_. 
2. **Development (Ontogeny)**: How does language mastery develop over an individual's lifespan? Children typically learn their first language through _immersion and mimicry_ in early life. 
3. **Function (Adaptation)**: What is the adaptive value of language mastery? Communication is vital for cooperation, which has clear benefits for survival and reproduction. 
4. **Evolution (Phylogeny)**: How has the ability for language mastery evolved? Comparing human language abilities to communication systems in other animals can provide insights.

## Language Acquisition Theory
Dr. Stephen Krashen's theory suggest that **language mastery** is best achieved through **comprehensible input (listening and reading) in a low-stress, supportive environment that encourages natural communication**, rather than through explicit grammar instruction and rote memorization.

- **The Acquisition-Learning Distinction**: Krashen distinguishes between acquisition, which is a subconscious and intuitive process of absorbing language, and learning, which is a conscious process of studying and learning rules. He suggests that true proficiency is achieved through acquisition rather than learning.
- **The Input Hypothesis**: Also known as the Comprehension Hypothesis, it suggests that language is acquired through understanding input that is slightly beyond the learner's current level of competence (i+1). This means that to progress in language learning, we need to understand messages that contain structures that we are ready to acquire, even if we haven't yet fully acquired them.
 - **The Affective Filter Hypothesis**: This hypothesis posits that a learner's emotional state, attitudes, and motivation can impact language acquisition. A low affective filter (i.e., low anxiety, high motivation, good self-confidence) enables language acquisition, while a high affective filter can block input and hinder the process.

## How to
### 3 key points
- A huge amount of repetition (active vocabulary, fluency over grammar)
- comprehensible input (listening and reading)
- Learn naturally and playfully Like a child (in a low-stress, supportive environment that encourages natural communication)

**free but narrow reading to achieve repetition in different situation** ( focus on similar topics across various media, such as books, podcasts, and movies)
