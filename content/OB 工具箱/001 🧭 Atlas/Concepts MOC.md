# Concepts MOC
---
_A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name._  
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts

Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three _strategic_ mental models: [OODA Loop](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/OODA+Loop), [Levels of Magnification](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Levels+of+Magnification), and [Refraction Thinking](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Refraction+Thinking).

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [Reps](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Reps), creating the conditions for [Flow](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Flow), which involves environmental [Forcing Functions](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Forcing+Function), and considering when I can multitask [Shadow Clone](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Shadow+Clone).

[Natural Selection](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Natural+Selection) is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [Lindy Effect](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Lindy+Effect), along with [Hormesis](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Hormesis) and [Antifragility](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Antifragility)—and also more broadly [Cause and Effect](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Cause+and+Effect). This reminds me of [Concept Expansion](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Concept+Expansion).

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [Yin and Yang](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Yin+and+Yang), [Synthesis](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Synthesis), [Seasons](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Seasons), and the [Mountain Top Water Drop](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Mountain+Top+Water+Drop). Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [No-Face](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/No-Face) from Spirited Away, which leads to [The Id](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/The+Id). [Aikido](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Aikido) is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [Rubik's Cube](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Rubik's+Cube), or pull from [Munger's Mental Models](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Munger's+Mental+Models).
