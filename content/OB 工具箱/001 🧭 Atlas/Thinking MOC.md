# Thinking MOC
---
My first instinct when thinking is to turn to [奇思异想](https://www.notion.so/d5d9a0a415fd4f86ae56d98282074dbc), where I jot down ideas that come to me throughout the day. 

I keep the [[Concepts MOC]] handy because I believe a handful of core concepts influence our entire worldview in disproportionately powerful ways. These notes help me make leaps of insights while connecting new ideas to existing concepts.

I'm a big believing in the power of prompts. A couple good prompts is enough to kickstart my thinking. 

- [[#Problem Solving]]
- [[#Decision Making]]
- [[#Systems Thinking]]

If you want to consider multiple angles when investigating behavior (field research), a useful tool to help us avoid easy, quick and superficial explanations is [[Tinbergen's Four Questions]]. In fact, you can use the framework to explore anything.

## Problem Solving
If you're working on a high-stakes problem, you might want to focus on specifically avoiding bad solutions.

[Inversion](https://untools.co/inversion) is a tool to make you see the problem from a different angle and avoid possible mistakes or bad outcomes.

### Break the problem down

It often helps to break big and complex problems into smaller, more manageable ones.

[Issue trees](https://untools.co/issue-trees) allow you to do this in a systematic way. It's great to tackle the problem in a "divide and conquer fashion".

Then there are [first principles](https://untools.co/first-principles) which focus on identifying the fundamental principles underlying a given problem. You can then build an original solution from these principles rather than from the initial problem statement.

### Frame the problem differently

[Abstraction laddering](https://untools.co/abstraction-laddering) will help you find alternative and innovative solutions by defining a the right problem (of which your initial problem might only be a subset of). You can [get a worksheet](https://gumroad.com/l/untools-worksheets) to get started with this tool.

### Come up with creative solutions

[Productive thinking model](https://untools.co/productive-thinking-model) gives you a six-step framework that will help you find creative solutions to the problems you're solving. It does that thanks to structured, critical thinking.

If you want to solve a problem _and_ gain clarity, a nice concept to brush up on is the [OODA Loop](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/OODA+Loop).

Outside the scope of the LYT Kit are my joyful suite of mind exercises. I love jumping into the gauntlet of [Thought Unpacking](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Thought+Unpacking) and [Thought Enriching](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Thought+Enriching)—both of which generate large quantities of [Thought Collisions](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Thought+Collisions). The "unpacking" is best to prompt critical and analytical thinking. The "enriching" is best to exercise the lateral, creative, and metaphorical muscles of the mind.

- Go to a few of your [Mind Palaces](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Mind+Palaces) to work your visualizing muscles.
- Combine the mental with the physical for the world-champion [Lucia Stance](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Lucia+Stance)
- A few grounding tactics are to brush up the [FlowCreation MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/FlowCreation+MOC) and [Habits MOC](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Habits+MOC)s.

Always remember, one of the best prompting tools out there is the thesaurus. So when you want to both jumpstart and enrich your thinking, grab a thesaurus and go on a [Word Excursion](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Word+Excursion).

## Definitions

Let's define some overlapping conceptual categories:

- **Concept**: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.
- **Mental Models** are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms that—_when applied to a current situation or thing_—allow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.
- **Metaphors** are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.
- [Refraction Thinking](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Refraction+Thinking) is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating.

## Three thinking styles

1. Top-down thinking
2. [Bottom-up thinking](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Bottom-up+thinking)
3. Middle-out thinking
